# ElderTeej Gameplay Guide  

## Getting Started and Important Mods:  

### Getting Started  

Create your character in Race Menu. There are presets available to test out by clicking on the Presets tab in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. You will have the option to Save Preset or Load Preset at the bottom of your screen- you can save your current build for future use, or load up one of the ones the list comes with from here. Please note that if you make a preset, the Discord has a channel to share it that will occasionally get included in the list!  

<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3797b659-7e4e-4ab0-b6a3-23ae4f068c18" />

You'll see a couple of start up screens:

<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37529f07-474d-44bf-a8a6-61e777a75f0e" />  

<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15593599-948b-4a5b-b08e-44bf3c77905e" />  

Follow their advice and let everything load before looting the room and speaking to the dragon at the end of the hall. You'll see the following screen when ready:  

<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a78f4b7-d110-4064-9b80-5e8b253d948f" />  

Once you speak to the dragon, you can pick a start for Alternate Perspective, then walk out the door next to him to begin the game. There is also a button behind the table to your immediate left that will let you do the vanilla game start, but at the end of the bear cave.  

<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aacc0172-8f4a-4723-a190-c712359c80d0" />  

After beginning your preferred start, you'll be prompted to enable Survival Mode if you want to, then you will be prompted to pick a deity.  

<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d9a3f8a-166c-47e3-928a-82fbe8bf39b2" />  

<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b742088-6f18-41f0-8451-8badb02cde92" />  

Once you've completed this, drop a manual save. I would recommend exiting after this save so you can let the Skyrim Save System Overhaul 3 Utility set things up so you can utilize that mod. It's extremely helpful in maintaining a healthy save, which is crucial in a list like this.  


### Skyrim Save System Overhaul 3  

[Skyrim Save System Overhaul 3](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122343) is a mod that allows for users to have a full, healthy save tied to the quicksave/quickload options on its surface, but it also adds in additional options such as timed saves and context-dependent saves.  

This list ships with [SSSO 3 Save Monitoring Utility](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/133502), as mentioned above. If you followed the steps above, restarting Skyrim should allow you to simply enable the mod. You can verify this by going to the following folder:  

<img width="1875" height="1095" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b4bb6e4-2504-4216-92c0-86af8c27748e" />  

Once in-game, you can enable SSSO3 by going to the Mod Configuration menu and selecting it. If everything is set up correctly, you'll be able to click "Enable Mod." This will close the MCM, but you can then re-open it and set your hotkeys/preferences accordingly. I recommend setting the timed save to save every 10-15 minutes to make sure you don't lose progress if you manage to die or CTD.  

<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84cff4dd-3816-48a4-b45d-486c1c56a62b" />  


### Dragonborn's Bestiary  

The list also ships with [The Dragonborn's Bestiary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123521), a mod that adds a menu to show you information on enemies, animals, or even ingredients you've come across. You can access it from the Esc menu or by pressing K.  

<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f34d5c35-ad9b-41b4-8522-c90a2e18d6f9" />  


### Quest Timing Changes  

There are a few mods that delay the timing of quests/DLCs in the list:  

- [Project AHO delay slavery](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37969): this adds an MCM option to delay the start of Project AHO. I hate running into that orc by accident! Enable the checkbox shown if you want to play through it.  
  
  <img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/613d7ec9-a0d4-45db-ad6d-51257f19d1ef" />  

- [Timing is Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464): allows you to delay the DLCs and some other miscellaneous quests, also configurable in MCM:

  <img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26e85fa1-8505-47fe-bee7-63bd76594dd3" />

  <img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bd3b373-c3d6-44e4-81b0-1dadf205d029" />  

- [The Choice is Yours](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3850): adds dialogue boxes or optional conversation choices to begin patched quests instead of locking the player into them immediately.

- [The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141327): the list has an optional delayed start- the quest only triggers by touching the Gray Fox bust inside the House of the Thief located along the river between Ivarstead and Riften.  

- [DAC0DA - Delayed Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136031): requires you to both be above level 25 and have finished the Yngol's Barrow quest before the mod Dac0da can be started.

- [VIGILANT - Delayed Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57961): requires you to have finished House of Horrors, Dac0da, and the Kindred Judgement quest from Dawnguard to begin Vigilant.

- [GLEN-MORIL - Delayed Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57963): makes it so you must do the following to start Glenmoril's main questline:

  - be level 25+  
  - complete Discerning the Transmundane  
  - complete Waking Nightmare  
  - complete At the Summit of Apocrypha (requires Dragonborn DLC)  
  - complete Censored Fate (requires Dac0da mod)  
  - complete Act 4 of Vigilant (requires Vigilant mod)  
  - complete Sacred Anatomancer (requires Vigilant mod)  
  - complete Ghost in the Mirror (Glenmoril dream visitor quest - see below)  

  You must do the following to start Glenmoril's meta quest:  

  - trigger at least 1 space-time fracture  
  - complete Censored Fate (requires Dac0da mod)  

  You must do the following to start Glenmoril's dream visitor quest:  

  - be level 25+ OR trigger at least 3 space-time fractures  
  - complete Discerning the Transmundane  
  - complete Waking Nightmare  
  - complete Censored Fate (requires Dac0da mod)  
  - complete Act 4 of Vigilant (requires Vigilant mod)  
  - complete Sacred Anatomancer (requires Vigilant mod)  
  - sleep  

- [UNSLAAD - Delayed Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57966): makes it so you must do the following to start Unslaad:  

  - be level 25+  
  - complete Dragonslayer (final main quest)  
  - complete Censored Fate (requires Dac0da mod)  
  - complete Act 4 of Vigilant (requires Vigilant mod)  
  - complete Sacred Anatomancer (requires Vigilant mod)  
  - complete Feast of Love (requires Glen-Moril mod)  
 
- [Radiant Requirements MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45427): allows you to delay certain radiant quests until you're a certain level.


### Combat  
The list has a few major changes to combat to be aware of:  

- [BFCO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117052): changes third person combat/NPC combat behaviors based on installed movesets. There is a MCM if you want to tweak combat behaviors.  

- [Dual Wield Parrying SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85505): adds a separate block button so you can have left-hand items equipped and still block. Also allows for spells in your left hand. Default key is set to Mouse4, but the Posts tab has the scan codes the included ini file needs if you want to change it for yourself. You will also need to change the Valhalla MCM options if you change your block key:

  <img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf6c2cee-5f6c-4dce-834a-900a4be4419f" />  


- [TK Dodge NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/115408): adds a dodge roll mechanic. List default is tap to dodge, set to the sprint key.  

- [Valhalla Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741): adds a stamina and blocking/parrying mechanic to combat. Has a MCM to change values if you want to tweak them, will need changes if you switch dual wield block key.

- [Chocolate Poise](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70478): adds a poise and stagger mechanic to combat. You should see a yellow bar in the HUD indicating stagger status.  


### BodySlide and Modified Bodies  

The list includes [CBBE 3BBB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174) and [HIMBO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46311) to change the bodies in-game and [OBody Next Generation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77016) (mod pages are NSFW- be warned) to distribute the different preset bodies throughout Skyrim. There is also a SFW profile as well with nevernude bodies as the default; simply select the Nevernude Default profile:  

<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eade1af-a5b0-4a3d-a0f2-d10874c79908" />  
Please note: **DO NOT** disable the non-Nevernude Bodyslide outputs, the Nevernude Outputs are **only** the updated nude bodies, so the other outputs are needed for the outfits to work.   

I recommend using the Group Manager function to load my pre-made groups and add your outfits to them in the interest of running the tool easier/more efficient in the future:  

<img width="1299" height="695" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef831c70-e0b9-4f5b-8358-fc195f66f3ee" />  

Hit "Browse," then load "ElderTeej.xml" and you should have 2 groups, Female and Male. You can add outfits to either group and hit "Save" to keep them permanently in the groups I set up.  

<img width="786" height="493" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ab71e74-dd1b-4781-8f09-8b7be9a83317" />  

Do not forget to choose the appropriate Bodyslide Outputs folder for the gender you are generating, as I have them separated.  

If you wish to change the body physics, the 3BBB installer has options for lighter physics, simply right-click the mod and hit re-install; for male bodies, you will need to update Bodyslide files.  

Additionally, if you add new CBBE or HIMBO outfits, you will need to update the outputs. Once again, there are separate Bodyslide outputs for male bodies and female bodies in the list; you will need to update the output folders accordingly. [The Bodyslide mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201) has usage instructions for the tool.  


### Handy Crafting and Spells  

[Handy Crafting and Spells](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64843) adds an auto-store feature for crafting materials and alchemy ingredients, as well as a few different spells for convenience. It is important to note that this will happen instantly, so if you are picking flowers, grabbing mushrooms, mining ore, whatever it is, and you don't see it in your inventory, you can access the stored ingredients at any point. There are spells for a bag of holding, access to your stored ingredients, sell the items in your bag of holding, and even summon a ghost mount if you don't already have a horse!  

(Placeholder, show screenshot of spells in menu)  

Ingredients will be restored to your inventory when crafting or when in a safe location (player homes, the Dragonborn Museum, etc.), and you can also turn auto-store on and off in the MCM. There's also a few other options, like the ability to auto-learn the alchemical properties of auto-stored ingredients when they get stored. This is disabled by default.  

(Placeholder, show MCM)  

Please remember: ingredients that are auto-stored will need to be manually retrieved if needing them for a quest, like in the Lost Echo Cave, where a glowing mushroom is needed. You will need to retrieve a mushroom from your stored ingredients to actually have one on hand for the quest.  

### Controller Support  

The list uses [Modern Controlmap](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89649) to set the controller mapping. I have not changed the default values, though the "Controller Support" separator has also set a [Dual Wield Parrying SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85505) blocking hotkey to X by default (Square for PS controllers). If you wish to change these values, edit the inis in the appropriate folders- both mods have the scan codes needed to re-map the controls in their Posts tab.  


## Troubleshooting:  


### Kodex Reports  

Thanks to our friend kyler45, there is a plugin included with the list called [Kodex](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/157869) that allows us to run a report to see if there are added mods or mods not matching the list's expected outputs, to see if any of your files are out of date or possibly corrupted. To run it, open the MO2 Tools menu (the puzzle piece icon at the top) and select Generate Support Report:  

<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dd8f2e2-94bc-4bd5-937e-090a99597c45" />  

Important: **DO NOT** select the "Golden" option, as this is meant for the author side, only.  

Reports will generate in the profile folder for your preferred profile:  

<img width="1875" height="1078" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eeb048b-23e6-40ba-a247-431e32b5cbf7" />  

Grab the .html file it generates and share it in the support channel on the Discord when asked.  


### Crashing  

If you are running into a repeatable crash, the team will need the logs from when the game crashes. Logs can be located in this folder in your Documents:  

<img width="1875" height="1078" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/735e5cdb-281a-4bbc-a258-a511c3dafe8f" />  

The file will always be a .log file that starts with "crash," as seen in the screenshot above. We will also need to know the context of when the game is crashing; think things like location, what you're doing, if you have followers, if you were casting a spell or had an AOE spell going, time of day if it's when entering a cell at a certain time but not others, etc. More or less, if you think it's pertinent, more info is better than less.  


### Landscape or Static Item Issues  

If you find landscape holes/seams or find floating/clipping/broken static items, the team will need some information from you so we can fix this in Creation Kit:  

- If the issue is a static item that is clearly just needing to be disabled, we will need a screenshot with the FormID so we can look the item up. Hit the ` key to launch the console, click on the offending item (or use your mouse wheel to scroll through until the item is what is clearly highlighted), then screenshot the whole window by hitting the Print Screen button.  

  It should look like this:  
  <img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9878abe1-052e-4964-b9b1-43182e9f5dd0" />  
  

- If the issue is a landscape seam/hole, or is a static object that needs to be adjusted instead of disabled, we will need a little more information than that. [This video by biggie_boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLibtlmBgRw) shows how to find the plugin information for a cell your character is in; we will need all plugins affecting the cell so we can recreate it in Creation Kit and generate a patch for the issue.  

  The screenshot for these issues should look like this:
  <img width="1211" height="686" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97d0f73e-5091-47b0-877a-751f76a6c07f" />  


### Performance Improvements  

There are a few options to improve performance on the list:  

- Install the performance LODs [from the Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/154704). Place these below the standard DynDOLOD Outputs in the left pane, then enable them and disable the old ones.  

- The list has the most up-to-date [SSE Engine Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230); the .toml file can be edited to enable/disable tweaks and memory fixes based on your PC. That file can be found in the below folder:  

  <img width="1875" height="1078" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d52e1622-2d3a-4773-952a-4032408f6feb" />  

- [Papyrus Tweaks NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77779) changes some of the ways scripting and memory stuff works, can be tweaked to allow more or less speed on scripting calls as your PC will tolerate. You can find the ini in the below folder:

  <img width="1875" height="1078" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2647972-1d56-4ee5-9be0-40173b16fbfc" />  
  

- [VRAMr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90557) is also included with the list if you want to use it to knock down VRAM usage from the textures the list uses. I highly recommend re-running all outputs AFTER Synthesis if you use VRAMr.


### Re-Running Outputs  

You may need to re-run outputs from time-to-time: broken install, rule 11 additions, maybe you've got a better rig than me and want better DynDOLOD outputs. Our friends at The Modding Bordello [have put together a comprehensive guide](https://github.com/HerrSchtevie/Scrolls-of-Schtevie/wiki/SOS-Tool-Running-Guide) that they've kindly allowed us permission to link to that breaks down all of the tools you may need to mess with. I always recommend keeping the outputs in the order shown below:  

<img width="454" height="370" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d002f175-3855-4f16-83e9-a1eb069eea2c" />  

Additionally, if you re-run Synthesis, you may need to re-forward changes from the ElderTeej Master Patch into Synthesis to maintain landscape fixes the team has already identified and fixed.  

You will need to open xEdit:  
<img width="2560" height="1400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37547c88-20d0-44f0-8438-718a3991dcfa" />  

Hit Ok on the Plugin Selection screen, then make sure not to select anything on the Mod Groups screen. Scroll down to the ElderTeej Master Patch (all the way toward the bottom) and expand it to get into the Worldspaces, as pictured:  

<img width="2092" height="1150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c4c38dd-4d8e-491f-acd5-a253943cf501" />  


From here, you can expand every worldspace edit in the patch; you are looking for the "Landscape" entry to look like below:  

<img width="2092" height="1150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f7e228d-cbd2-459b-a841-f7cbadc47bda" />  


If the word "Landscape" is red, you will need to drag the column that says "ElderTeej Master Patch.esp" at the top over the column that says "Synthesis.esp." Once you have confirmed that all landscape edits from the master patch are the winning values, exit xEdit and save when prompted. This process is applicable for **any** time you run Synthesis.
