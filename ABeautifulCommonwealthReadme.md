**Welcome to A Beautiful Commonwealth!**



This list is an attempt to build for Fallout 4 what NGVO did for Skyrim – a beautiful, stable list to serve as either a fun, almost entirely vanilla gameplay-wise Fallout 4 experience or to add your own quest and content mods to!


**A couple of highlights:**  
- Fallout 4 HD Overhaul 2k as the base, with FlaconOil's textures, NMC's Texture Bundle, and Targeted Textures Extended helping cover some more ground!  
- The full FallUI suite, with FIS and Complex Sorter configured!  
- Upgraded vanilla clothing with CBBE support!  
- The Fungal Forest for a cool and updated take on the Glowing Sea!  
- Immersive Animation Framework!   
- True Storms!  
- Ketaros World!  
- So much more! [Full load order here!](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/a-beautiful-commonwealth)

I wanted to make a fun, modern feeling Fallout 4 that's ready for an enjoyable playthrough out of the box, and also for you to add what you want! There's also an included fast start mod (SKK Fast New Start) and DavesMods - In Game ESP Explorer for QoL if you add anything new!

**Pre-install:**  
- Ensure your Fallout 4 install is clean and up to date. This generally means deleting all vanilla Fallout files and reinstalling through the "verify game files" option in Steam. You should do this for Creation Kit as well as you will need Creation Kit for this list, too.  
- Make sure all Visual C++ Redistributables and .NET frameworks are up to date.  
- Set a 40 GB page file.  
- Ensure you have installed Creation Kit (repeating this is not a typo).  
- Run both Fallout 4 AND Creation Kit from Steam.  

**Manual Installation notes:**  
- Download main file and extract the .wabbajack file from the archive.  
- Open Wabbajack and go to "Browse Lists" on the left-hand menu.  
- On the top of the UI, you should see a button that says "Install from Disk." Select this and navigate to the .wabbajack file you extracted. Let the installer run.  
- Open Mod Organizer 2. To start the game, make sure "A Beautiful Commonwealth" is selected in the right-hand corner and hit play.  



**IMPORTANT NOTES:**  
- This is currently a 1.10.163 list – if you're going to add mods to the list, you **MUST** ensure you're using the correct version of them. A NG version will also be uploaded at some point.  
- The list ships with Creation Kit Platform Extended, but it is installed as a mod. If you want to use it, enable the mod in the list, then launch Creation Kit. Make sure you disable it before playing.
