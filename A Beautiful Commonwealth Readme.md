Welcome to A Beautiful Commonwealth!


This list is an attempt to build for Fallout 4 what NGVO did for Skyrim- provide a beautiful, stable list to serve as either a fun, almost entirely vanilla gameplay-wise Fallout 4 experience or to add your own quest and content mods to!


A couple of highlights:
-Fallout 4 HD Overhaul 2k as the base, with FlaconOil's textures, NMC's Texture Bundle, and Targeted Textures Extended helping cover some more ground!  
-The full FallUI suite, with FIS and Complex Sorter configured!  
-Upgraded vanilla clothing with CBBE support!  
-The Fungal Forest for a cool and updated take on the Glowing Sea!  
-Immersive Animation Framework!  
-True Storms!
-Ketaros World!
-So much more! [Full load order here!](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/a-beautiful-commonwealth)

I wanted to make a fun, modern feeling Fallout 4 that's ready for an enjoyable playthrough out of the box, but is completely ready for you to add what you want! There's also an included fast start mod ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29227]SKK Fast New Start[/url]) and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42520]DavesMods - In Game ESP Explorer[/url] for QoL if you add anything new!
