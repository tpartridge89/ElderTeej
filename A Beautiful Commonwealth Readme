Welcome to A Beautiful Commonwealth!


This list is an attempt to build for Fallout 4 what NGVO did for Skyrim- provide a beautiful, stable list to serve as either a fun, almost entirely vanilla gameplay-wise Fallout 4 experience or to add your own quest and content mods to!


A couple of highlights:
-Fallout 4 HD Overhaul 2k as the base, with FlaconOil's textures, NMC's Texture Bundle, and Targeted Textures Extended helping cover some more ground!  
-The full FallUI suite, with FIS and Complex Sorter configured!  
-Upgraded vanilla clothing with CBBE support!  
-The Fungal Forest for a cool and updated take on the Glowing Sea!  
-So much more!
