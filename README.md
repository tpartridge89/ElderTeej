# ElderTeej
Welcome to the ElderTeej Wabbajack list!

What started as a fork of another popular modlist has become my own work, taking my tweaked combat, every supported quest or item with a display in the Legacy of the Dragonborn museum, and plenty of visual goodness! Also includes some QoL tweaks, vanilla skill leveling with Experience on top, and some old favorites like Mysticism and Vokord, and my choices in PBR textures now that we've moved the list to Community Shaders!


**Some highlights:**  
Witchy Wilderness  
Animated Armoury WITH the unofficial LOTD integration!  
Apocalypse  
Trade and Barter  
Skyrim Save System Overhaul 3 (SSSO 3)  
Lost Grimoire SSE  
And SO much more! Check out the [full load order here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/elderteej-3)!

**Requirements:**  
This list requires Skyrim Special Edition with all Anniversary Edition content installed, as well as needing Creation Kit.  

As far as technical requirements: I recommend at least 32 GB of RAM for modded Skyrim, and running the list at 1440 generally pulls 6-8 GB of VRAM, so a 4070 or higher is recommended for 1440. The CS switch has really freed performance headroom up, but this is still a heavily overhauled world and you may need to enable Upscaling and use some of its frame generation options if you have a lower-end PC.  

**Pre-install:**  
- Ensure your Skyrim install is clean and up to date. This generally means deleting all vanilla Skyrim files and reinstalling through the "verify game files" option in Steam. Ensure you do this for Creation Kit as well.    
- Make sure all Visual C++ Redistributables and .NET frameworks are up to date.  
- Set a 40 GB page file   
- Run both Skyrim and Creation Kit from Steam. If you haven't downloaded the AE Creation Club files yet, you will need to do so when running Skyrim.  

**Post-install:**  
- When launching, ensure you have "ElderTeej" selected in the upper right-hand corner.  
- Please allow everything to load fully before selecting a start in the beginning cell- this is a VERY script heavy portion of things. You should get a message stating "Museum List Building Complete" when everything is ready.
- [A full gameplay guide is now available!](https://github.com/tpartridge89/ElderTeej/blob/main/Gameplay%20Guide.md)

**Important hot keys:**  
G to toggle helmet  
H to call horse  
M4 for dual wield blocking  
DEL for STB Widgets menu  
END for Community Shaders menu

**Important notes:**  
- Upscaling for Community Shaders is included in the list, feel free to deactivate it if you do not want it running or experience ghosting/artifacting.  
- There is controller support through Modern Controlmap but will require some setup/config. Please see the gameplay guide for recommendations and instructions.
