What started as a fork of another popular modlist has become my own work, taking my tweaked version of the combat suite and safe save/death alternatives from the Journals of Jyggalag, every supported quest or item with a display in the Legacy of the Dragonborn museum, and plenty of visual goodness! Also includes some QoL tweaks, vanilla skill leveling with Experience on top, and some old favorites like Mysticism, Ordinator, and my implementation of what I'm dubbing The Great Cities of JK's Northern Roads.

Some highlights:
Witchy Wilderness  
Animated Armoury WITH the unofficial LOTD integration!  
Apocalypse  
Trade and Barter  
Skyrim Save System Overhaul 3 (SSSO 3)  
Lost Grimoire SSE  
And SO much more! Check out the [full load order here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/elderteej-3)!

Requirements:
I have not been able to test this across other PCs to be able to tell you what can and can't run it. I will state that I recommend at least 32 GB of RAM for modded Skyrim, and that running the list at 1440 generally pulls 9-10 GB of VRAM, so a 4070 or higher is recommended for 1440. My current build gets occasional lag spikes and I have a Ryzen 9 5900x and a 4070 Super. Unfortunately, JK's Skyrim is heavy and I can't do much to alleviate that draw, but I have included VRAMr to knock down the performance hit as much as possible while maintaining visual fidelity if you need to run it. This list is HUGE and you will need ~550 GB of disk space free- install plus downloads looks to be about 528 GB if you have VRAMr outputs. 

Pre-install:  
-Ensure your Skyrim install is clean and up to date. This generally means deleting all vanilla Skyrim files and reinstalling through the "verify game files" option in Steam.   
-Make sure all Visual C++ Redistributables and .NET frameworks are up to date.  
-Set a 40 GB page file   
-Run both Skyrim from Steam. If you haven't downloaded the AE Creation Club files yet, you will need to do so when running Skyrim.  
-Wabbajack occasionally has issues downloading High Poly Head- I recommend manually downloading it here and placing the file in the folder you intend to use for your mod downloads prior to installing through the Wabbajack UI if you have issues.

Important hot keys:  
G to toggle helmet  
H to call horse  
M4 for dual wield blocking  
DEL for STB Widgets menu  
END for ENB menu  

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ACTIVELY BEING PATCHED. I only have this live because I'm hoping for people to help me get this fixed and maybe add some cool stuff to it later, but I don't have a team and I didn't build mods before this; I'm just a guy with a hyperfocus who loves Bethesda games!

Special thanks to:  
HerrSchtevie and the whole Journals of Jyggalag crew for their awesome list that gave me the combat and saving options!  
DarkLadyLexy for Lexy's LOTD Guide that I loosely followed for some structure and stability ideas!  
Biggie for NGVO, which gave me a lot of the visual inspiration for the list!
